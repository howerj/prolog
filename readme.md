This is a toy Prolog language interpreter, a reimplementation of one
by Alan Mycroft, available at <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/research/funnel/prolog2020.cpp>,
with a paper describing it available at <https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/papers/wflp00.pdf>.

It implements very little of the language, just the core of idea of it. This
implementation includes a parser and garbage collection making it slightly
more useful, for very small values of use. Consult the source for documentation
and a list of to-dos.

This interpreter is still being worked on, it should be considered to be in "alpha"
status.
